==========================
Creating and Adding Groups
==========================

- ``import cctk`` is assumed.

"""""""""""""""""""""""
Using a Preloaded Group
"""""""""""""""""""""""

- *cctk* comes with several groups defined by default (listed below).
- To add a group, use the ``add_group_to_molecule`` function to generate a new molecule.
- The atom the group is added to must only be making one bond; usually a hydrogen is a good choice.

**Preloaded Groups**

::

    from cctk.load_groups import load_group

    # load our starting molecule
    formic_acid = cctk.GaussianFile.read_file("formic_acid.out").get_molecule()

    # to load a predefined group, use the group's name
    trifluoromethyl = load_group("trifluoromethyl")
    assert isinstance(trifluoromethyl, cctk.Group)

    # now we can create a new molecule by adding our group to an existing molecule 
    # here we specify to add the group to atom 4, the formyl proton, to give us TFA
    trifluoroacetic_acid = cctk.Group.add_group_to_molecule(formic_acid, trifluoromethyl, 4)
    assert isinstance(trifluoroacetic_acid, cctk.Molecule)

    # if we want to track old atom numbers in the new molecule, we can return a dictionary converting between old and new numberings
    trifluoroacetic_acid, m_map, g_map = cctk.Group.add_group_to_molecule(formic_acid, trifluoromethyl, 4, return_mapping=True)
    # now mmap[1] tells us the new number of atom #1 in formic acid and gmap[1] tells us the new number of atom #1 in the trifluoromethyl group

""""""""""""""""""""""
Creating a New Group
""""""""""""""""""""""

- We can create a new ``Group`` object from any molecule by specifying which atom to make the attachment point from. 
- As before, the ``attach_to`` atom must only be making one bond; usually a hydrogen is a good choice.

::

    # define a new group, where the attachment point is atom 6 (a methyl-group hydrogen)
    file = cctk.GaussianFile.read_file("acetaldehyde.out")
    acetaldehyde = file.get_molecule()
    group = cctk.Group.new_from_molecule(attach_to=6, molecule=acetaldehyde)

    # now create a new molecule by adding the new group to atom 5 (another hydrogen on acetaldehyde)
    new_mol = cctk.Group.add_group_to_molecule(acetaldehyde, group, 5)
    file.write_file("1,4-butanedione.gjf", molecule=new_mol)

    # we can also define a group by using the remove_group_from_molecule function
    # this code will split the molecule along the C1â€“C7 bond -- the C1 fragment will become a molecule and the C7 fragment will become a group
    alanine = cctk.GaussianFile.read_file("alanine.gjf").get_molecule().assign_connectivity()
    molecule, carboxyl_group = cctk.Group.remove_group_from_molecule(alanine, 1, 7)

""""""""""""""""
Epimerization
""""""""""""""""

- *cctk* can automatically combine group addition/removal to epimerize stereogenic centers.

::

    # exchanges substituent atoms sub1 and sub2 (and attached groups) around atom center
    enantiomer = molecule.epimerize(center, sub1, sub2)
