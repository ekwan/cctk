This tutorial will teach:

- Rotation/translation of ``Molecule`` objects.
- Direct creation and editing of ``Molecule`` objects.

Overview
========

Metal triflates are frequently employed as "M+" precursors in Lewis-acid-catalyzed transformations, since the weakly-binding triflate can easily be displaced by Lewis-basic ligands. 
However, reported anion effects imply that "weakly-coordinating anions" like triflate may indeed have a non-negligible effect on catalysis. 
In `one such study <http://evans.rc.fas.harvard.edu/pdf/evans245.pdf>`_ by Evans and coworkers, 
the counterion for a Cu(II)-tBuBox complex was found to have a dramatic effect on rate and small effects on enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity,
indicating that one or more equivalents of the counterion are present in the transition state:

Understanding how anions are bound to cationic catalysts could improve mechanistic understanding and lead to the design of improved catalytic systems. 
Computational modelling of weakly-bound ion pairs is difficult, however, because of the potential for numerous nearly degenerate binding modes.  
Accordingly, many distinct arrangements must be sampled and evaluated: although such an approach would be tedious by hand, automation with *cctk* renders it facile. 

This tutorial will focus on evaluating the ground-state conformation of Evans's system for the hexafluoroantimonate and triflate anions. 
We will make the simplifying assumption that only one anion will coordinate to the catalyst at a time, consistent with observation of singly-cationic metalâ€“ligand complexes in solution. 

Creating Structures
===================

The structures of Cu(II)-tBuBox (S=1/2 dication), SbF\ :sub:`6` (S=0 anion), and OTf (S=0 anion) were first optimized separately at the 
UB3LYP-D3BJ/6-31G(d)-SDD(Sb,Cu)/SMD(dichloromethane) level of theory. 

In order to efficiently manipulate the ion pair, all molecules were loaded into *cctk* and then centered:: 

    def center_molecule(molecule):
        """
        Moves a ``Molecule`` object's centroid to the origin
        """
        atoms = np.arange(0, molecule.num_atoms())
        molecule.translate_molecule(-molecule.geometry[atoms].mean(axis=0))
        return molecule

    cation = center_molecule(GaussianFile.read_file("CuII-tBuBox-dication.out").get_molecule())
    anion1 = center_molecule(GaussianFile.read_file("SbF6_anion.out").get_molecule())
    anion2 = center_molecule(GaussianFile.read_file("OTf_anion.out").get_molecule())

    anions = [anion1, anion2]
    anion_names = ["SbF6", "OTf"]

To determine the relative position of the two molecules, a random vector was sampled from a spherical distribution::

    def spherical_random(radius=1):
        """
        Generates a random point on a sphere of radius ``radius``.
        """
        v = np.random.normal(size=3)
        v = v/np.linalg.norm(v)
        return v * radius

The anion was then rotated randomly about all 3 Cartesian axes, and the atomic numbers and coordinates were concatenated to produce a new ``Molecule`` object. 
The output structures were written to ``.gjf`` files::

    for i in range(num_structures):
        trans_v = spherical_random(radius=8)
        for j in range(len(anions)):

            x = copy.deepcopy(anions[j])
            x.translate_molecule(trans_v)
            x.rotate_molecule(np.array([1,0,0]), np.random.random()*360)
            x.rotate_molecule(np.array([0,1,0]), np.random.random()*360)
            x.rotate_molecule(np.array([0,0,1]), np.random.random()*360)

            atoms = np.hstack((cation.atomic_numbers.T, x.atomic_numbers.T))
            geoms = np.vstack((cation.geometry, x.geometry))

            mx = Molecule(atomic_numbers=atoms, geometry=geoms, charge=1, multiplicity=2)
            GaussianFile.write_molecule_to_file(f"CuII-tBuBox-{anion_names[j]}_c{i}.gjf", mx, "#p opt b3lyp/genecp empiricaldispersion=gd3bj scrf=(smd, solvent=dichloromethane)", footer)


The complete script (``generate_ion_pairs.py``) looks like this::
    
    import copy
    import numpy as np

    num_structures = 25

        return v * radius
