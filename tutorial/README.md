## Tutorials

The following folders contain sample projects which are intended to demonstrate how `cctk` can be used. 

#### `dinucleotide_conformations`:

Demonstrates how to quickly generate many different conformations from a given input structure. 

#### `dipeptide_conf_search`:

Walks you through the process of generating different conformations, parsing and analyzing the output (from Gaussian), and resubmitting at higher levels of theory. 
(Requires access to Gaussian.)
