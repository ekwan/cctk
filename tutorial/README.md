## Tutorials

The following folders contain sample projects which are intended to demonstrate how `cctk` can be used. 

#### Tutorial 1: `dinucleotide_conformations`:

Demonstrates how to quickly generate many different conformations from a given input structure. 

#### Tutorial 2: `dipeptide_conf_search`:

Walks you through the process of generating different conformations, parsing and analyzing the output (from Gaussian), and resubmitting at higher levels of theory. 
(Requires access to Gaussian.)

#### Tutorial 3: `moj_plot`:

Demonstrates how to use *cctk* to create structures spanning a 2D potential-energy surface, and how to parse and analyze this data. 
(Requires access to Gaussian.)

#### Tutorial 4: `nics_ene`:

Teaches how to extract structures from IRC calculations and visualize how molecular parameter (e.g. NICS, Hirschfeld charges) change along the reaction coordinate. 
(Requires access to Gaussian.)
