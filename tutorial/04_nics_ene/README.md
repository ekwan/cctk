#### Tutorial 4: Analyzing Charges and NICS Along the Reaction Coordinate

Analysis of higher-order properties along a potential energy surface is frequently complicated by the multitude of jobs required. 
For instance, analyzing the change in atomic charges or aromaticity (as measured by nucleus-independent chemical shift, or NICS)
requires a separate job for each desired point, making manual analysis challenging. 

##### Step 1: Finding Points Along the Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate

##### Step 2: Generating Jobs to Calculate NICS(0)/Hirschfeld Charges (`generate_nics.py`)

##### Step 3: Analysis (`analyze_nics.py`)
